# Genetic-Algorithm
N-Queens problem solved via an evolution emulating algorithm. The idea is to place a queen (like
a chess queen) on a board in every single column and row so that none of them are in a position
to attack one another (no diagonal, horizontal or verticle collisions).

If you would like to run this, compile the java appropriately and run the GeneticAlgorithm class.
The output is formated in a number for each column.
I.E a solution would be 52814736,
